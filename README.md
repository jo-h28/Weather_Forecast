# Weather_Forecast v.01
A weather forecast application using Java Swing and Open Weather Map API

## What is API
In computer programming, an application programming interface (API) is a set of subroutine definitions, protocols, and tools for building application software. In general terms, it is a set of clearly defined methods of communication between various software components. Application programming interfaces make it easier for developers to use certain technologies in building applications. By abstracting the underlying implementation and only exposing objects or actions the developer needs, an API simplifies programming.

In this software, the developer uses an API called `Open Weather Map`. This API is used to access informations about cities' current weather data, and/or daily forecasts.

## Packages
- API : Classes containing methods to request data from `Open Weather Map`.
- DATA : Classes containing data received from API.
- GUI : Classes containing methods to show data based on user's input, displaying city's weather information, graphic icons, search list and such.

## Features
- [x] Search for a city/list of cities
